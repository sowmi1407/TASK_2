FIRST FILE:

THE ORIGINAL IMAGE WAS HEAVILY BLURRED, MAKING OCR EXTRACTION DIFFICULT. TO ENHANCE TEXT CLARITY, THE IMAGE WAS FIRST CONVERTED TO GRAYSCALE , RESIZED  AND SHARPENED USING UNSHARPMASK FILTER 

SECOND FILE:

THE IMAGE CONTAINED RED-COLORED FONTS AND DOTTED LINES, WHICH MADE OCR EXTRACTION HARD.  THE IMAGE WAS CONVERTED TO GRAYSCALE, ITS CONTRAST WAS ENHANCED USING IMAGEENHANCE.CONTRAST AND ALSO BINARIZATION WAS APPLIED

I ALSO ATTEMPTED TO REMOVE THE DOTTED LINES USING AN HORIZONTAL CONVULUTIONAL KERNEL . THIS WAS ABLE TO HANDLE THE DOTTED LINES WELL BUT IT ALSO AFFECTED THE MAIN BODY TEXT LEADING TO RANDOM WORDS BEING EXTRACTED 

THIRD FILE:

THE IMAGE CONTAINED MULTIPLE TEXT COLUMNS. TO HANDLE THIS, OCR CONFIGURATION USED PSM 1  WHICH IS SUITABLE FOR BLOCKS OF TEXT
